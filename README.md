## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow to identify skin cancer

- What is the background of your project?
    Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

- What is the dataset that is being used?
    The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant


## Conclusions
- We have created multiple models that solved the problems of overfitting/underfitting in the base models and our final model is able to  predict 80% accureately in the validation dataset

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8.8
- tensorflow 2.2.0
- Augmentor-0.2.9
